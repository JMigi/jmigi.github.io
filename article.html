        </p>
<p>Xenagos, God of Revels, or as many call him, Xenagod, is the Commander that I think most captures what Gruul is all about. He wants you to ramp into the biggest and flashiest fatties and smash face as hard and fast as you can. I want to share two decklists I’ve built for this deathbringing deity, one under $200 which I will mostly be focusing on and another with no expense spared, and how they work. But first,</p>

        <h1><b>Why Xenagos?</b></h1>

<p>For starters, as a God creature from Theros, Xenagos is extremely difficult to remove as not only is he Indestructible, but most of the time, he isn’t even a creature. On top of that, having to recast him after the odd Return to Dust won’t feel too bad in a deck packed with ramp. No other Commander has such built in security.</p>

<p>Xenagos runs an odd sort of aggressive deck, but in a good way. Most aggro decks have to rely on go-wide strategies and need multiple cards and set ups to build a threatening board. Xenagos only needs Xenagos, and a big guy per turn, and that’s assuming your fatties are getting constantly removed. No need to worry about your boards getting wiped and yours resources going down the drain because you only need to invest one or two creatures at a time. And unlike other aggro decks, Xenagos uses great ramp, and can play at all stages of the game instead of running out of juice after a couple of board wipes.</p>

<p>But most importantly of all, there is just no other deck in the format that can consistently hit with gigantic spine-breaking power turn after turn thanks to Xenagos’ ability to grant Haste and essentially double the stats of whatever titan you’ve just played.</p>

<h1><b>Ammunition</b></h1>

<p>These are the most important and most fun cards of the deck, the big guys. Ideally, you want around 20-25 of these in your deck, most of them having a CMC of 6-7 so that you can play them after you play Xenagos. There are of course many large creatures printed throughout the game’s history, so you should abide by several rules when selecting your bullets.</p>

<p>1. The creature should generate value immediately. Pelakka Wurm and Gruul Ragebeast are good examples, as the former immediately gains you seven life (and a card draw once it dies), and the latter more or less serves as six damage worth of creature removal upfront, and can potentially do more should it still be there when you play more creatures. ETB triggers are ideal in case someone has spot removal, but because Xenagos gives Haste combat and damage triggers are acceptable as well. Hellkite Tyrant and Etali, Primal Storm are two examples I’m particularly fond of. With Haste, Hellkite Tyrant can immediately steal a player’s ENTIRE stockpile of Artifacts, and Etali randomly nets you value between everyone topdecking unplayable lands to you virtually winning the game.</p>

<p>2. They’re big. This is pretty straightforward and obvious, but I should say it anyway. If the creature is below five power, you should probably forget about it.</p>

<p>3. The creature has built in evasion. Flying and Trample tend to be the most common. Having a 20/20 or 40/40 fatty attacking immediately is a lot less impressive if it gets chump blocked by a Zombie token or something (Which is why Grunn, the Lonely King isn’t as good in this deck as he looks). Of course, in an EDH game, there’s often at least one player who has nothing to block with, but it’s always better to be in control of who you’re free to hit.</p>

<p>4. They have built in protection. This isn’t as important, but it should definitely be considered. Stonehoof Chieftain’s Indestructible can be a huge pain to deal with. Spearbreaker Behemoth is popular for the same reason and Siege Behemoth’s Hexproof is nice, although I personally don’t run them.</p>

<p>You may notice that many of the creatures in this list have a mix of these rules that they do or do not fulfill. For example, Atarka, World Render has absolutely no value or protection, but she’s a 6/4 Trample and Flying AND Double Striking creature. She hits so hard under Xenagos that she’s a shoe-in. As a side note, if you happen to have any other dragons, she supports them too. Inferno Titan has no evasion, but has a divisible Lightning Bolt as an ETB, and does it again when they attack with Haste on the same turn, plus firebreathing stats that Xenagos doubles should you have any spare red mana.</p>

<p>There are some more specific fatties I want to talk about, some honorable mentions, and upgrades for those with cash to burn.</p>

<p>Malignus: Oh boy. With his power modifier and Xenagos’ Haste and stat doubling ability, he can kill anybody at the table in one hit. Make sure your table or friend group is OK with this, because this card it the one most likely to make you “that guy” in your playgroup.</p>

<p>Deus of Calamity: Sometimes it feels like this card was made for the deck. He’s big, he has Trample, and he has a combat damage trigger that turns from “only if he’s unblocked” to most likely going to happen thanks to Xenagos doubling his power. The only downside is his color costs which will animated Xenagos, and may be a problem if you end up with too many colorless lands. Just try not to be a jerk with his land destruction ability and hit the Sultai player’s one Island or something.</p>

<p>Hydra Omnivore: I know he breaks all of the rules except for being big, but his ability is so fun and goofy I have to run him. Besides, as his flavor text implies, nobody can accuse you of playing favorites when you punch with this hydra. Keep in mind that the damage that hits the other players can be redirected to Planeswalkers.</p>

<p>Hellkite Charger and Savage Ventmaw: An infamous combo. With both of these cards on board, you can get an extra combat phase for every spare mana you have. Remember that Xenagos boosts last until the end of the turn, so you can reach quadruple power, hextuple, etc.</p>

<p>Ghalta, Primal Hunger: HE’S VERY LARGE and maybe even VERY CHEAP</p>

<p>Now for some honorable mentions:</p>

<p>Ruric Thar, the Unbowed: He’s flavorful and fun, but he didn’t make the cut with me because he has no evasion. The deck also isn’t so creature heavy that we’ll always escape his punishment ability.</p>

<p>Garruk’s Horde: A 7/7 with Trample is good, and his effect looks nice on paper. But if you think about it, his effect is basically conditional card draw that you often won’t have the mana for.</p>

<p>Siege Behemoth: Has Hexproof and “Super Trample”. Personal choice on this one.</p>

<p>Siege Dragon: The poor man’s Balefire Dragon. Run if you end up fighting a lot of token decks or something.</p>

<p>Spearbreaker Behemoth: It’s a hassle to hold up mana for his ability sometimes, but mostly I think 5/5 with no evasion isn’t good enough for a seven mana creature. He is Indestructible and excellent protection for your future creatures though.</p>

<p>Tyrant’s Familiar: Kind of a stupid reason from me, but it just feels weird running a creature that already has Haste in Xenagos. Definitely a solid choice though.</p>

<p>Archetype of Endurance: No evasion. I’d probably let it slide if it cost less than eight mana.</p>

<p>Borborygmos Enraged: He’s pretty good. The only reason why he isn’t on the list is my personal taste and competition over card slots.</p>

<p>Upgrades:</p>

<p>Balefire Dragon: Your opponent with the big board had better hope it includes a Flyer (or that most of their board is Indestructible or somehow more than 12 toughness) or it’s going up in flames.</p>

<p>Vorinclex, Voice of Hunger: He’s a big Trample fatty who doubles your mana as long as he’s alive and will at the very least cripple whoever casts something to get rid of him. Also a flavor win as he’s all about survival of the fittest and the biggest baddest creatures in the lore.</p>

<p>Kozilek, the Butcher of Truth and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger: Both are gigantic, have useful ETB triggers, and big Annihilator values they can use immediately with Haste.</p>

<h1><b>Ramp</b></h1>

<p>I’d love to talk about fatties and how cool they are all day, but bullets don’t fire themselves and neither do creatures. As a green deck with expensive creatures, we need quality ramp to make sure that not only are we ready to go, but we’re ready quickly. A few notes before we get started.</p>

<p>You should be running at least 10 ramp cards to ensure that you have acceleration before turn 5 and that you’re not wanting for mana later. Ramp spells are also a good thing to dump leftover mana into after you’ve played a fatty for the turn. Try to avoid creature based ramp if you can help it, they die easily. Of course if everything goes as planned, a couple of elves can really speed Xenagos and your other cards into play, but I’d rather rely on land based ramp that is much more likely to stay on the board. Thins the deck out too.</p>

<p>Ramp is pretty straightforward but some specific cards:</p>

<p>Sol Ring: Duh</p>

<p>Somberwald Sage: Unfortunately tied to a creature, but incredible in a deck that mainly cares about big guys. Shaman of the Forgotten Ways fills a similar role if you choose to run it.</p>

<p>Drumhunter: Not the best ramp, but pretty reliably draws you cards, so I like it.</p>

<p>From Beyond: Lets you “save” mana for later in the form of the tokens. Also can be sacrificed to tutor either the Rapacious One or the Artisan of Kozilek. For people with money, the Eldrazi Titans.</p>

<p>If you feel you need more ramp, Grow From the Ashes, Nature’s Lore, Farseek, Nissa’s Pilgrimage, Search for Tomorrow, Explore, and a number of Artifacts are good choices.</p>

<p>Traverse the Outlands is kind of a winmore card, but I have to mention it for the sheer amount of lands it can pull out of your deck in Xenagos, if that’s what you’re into. A little pricy moneywise for a flashy ramp card.</p>

<p>Oracle of Mul Daya is incredible if you have 20 disposable bills.</p>

<h1><b>Reloading</b></h1>

<p>Otherwise known as card draw. We need a way to get more fatties ready to fire and whatever else we need. Ramp is pointless without cards to spend the mana on. Xenagos does not have Blue or Black, and as we don’t care about graveyard or discard synergy much, Red’s loot based draw doesn’t help much either. Fortunately, we can usually get by with the card advantage we do have, and the quality of our draws increasing thanks to our ramp pulling lands out of our deck.</p>

<p>Duskwatch Recruiter: We have enough creatures in the deck that his ability will usually hit something, so I consider him reliable.</p>

<p>Elemental Bond: Turns all of your big guys into cantrips. Excellent.</p>

<p>Fierce Empath: Who would have guessed a card that tutors for expensive creatures would be good in a deck full of expensive creatures?</p>

<p>Yavimaya Elder: Grabs two basic lands from your deck on death, and if you have one more mana, can kill itself and draw a card.</p>

<p>Harmonize: One of if not the best draw spell green has.</p>

<p>Solemn Simulacrum, Drumhunter, and From Beyond: Also ramp</p>

<p>Garruk, Caller of Beasts: Similar to Duskwatch Recruiter, but way better.</p>

<p>See the Unwritten: If you think about it, it’s a random creature you just played out of your deck. If you already have a creature, now it’s two.</p>

<p>Soul of the Harvest and Pelakka Wurm: Fatties who just happen to often draw cards</p>

<p>Hunter’s Insight, Momentous Fall, Hunter’s Prowess, and Rishkar’s Prowess: In a deck with double statted hasty giants, these are the jackpot cards. Remember that Momentous Fall gains you life, requires the creature to be sacrificed (a great instant response to removal), and works based on toughness. Also remember to use Hunter’s Prowess before Xenagos activates, in order to double that +3 and boost your card draw even more.</p>

<p>With money, you can play cool things like:</p>

<p>Sylvan Library: Free big scrying, and cards at the expense of life.</p>

<p>Selvala, Heart of the Wilds: You’re usually the one who’s going to get the draws. The mana can also lead to some very choice plays.</p>

<p>Oracle of Mul Daya: Also Ramp.</p>

<h1><b>Tools and accessories</b></h1>

<p>We aren’t going to play like Joey Wheeler. We’re going to need some removal, boardwipes, and generally good cards to support out monsters.</p>

<p>Artifact/Enchantment Hate:</p>

<p>Vandalblast: I think every deck that has red should be running this. It is extremely good.</p>

<p>Hull Breach: A Gruul deck’s secret weapon, cheap removal that can two for one at the right time.</p>

<p>Beast Within: Can cheaply remove ANYTHING at instant speed, leaving a measly 3/3 in return. In maybe 3% of games, you might end up using it on your own stuff just to get a 6/6 Haste token.</p>

<p>Bane of Progress: A boardwipe for Artifacts and Enchantments that usually won’t hit us as hard. Try to get him grown big so that he can punch face.</p>

<p>Hellkite Tyrant: It’s technically a one player Artifact boardwipe if you just steal all their Artifacts. Don’t count on getting his alternate wincon though.</p>

<p>Woodfall Primus: Can hit two things with Persist, and is a Trampling fatty to boot.</p>

<p>If you need more Artifact and Enchantment hate, Decimate is a blowout card, but I prefer not to run it because it needs a valid target for each type of card. Krosan Grip is a solid Split Second answer. </p>

<p>Boardwipes:</p>

<p>Blasphemous Act: Probably the best red boardwipe. Guaranteed to kill all but the toughest creatures. Speaking of which, many of the creatures in this deck can in fact survive 13 damage after getting a boost from Xenagos, so using it after hitting someone is a good idea. The best part is that the more things you need to kill, the cheaper it gets. It’s common for it to only cost a single red.</p>

<p>Chandra’s Ignition: Not the best boardwipe because it requires you to have a big creature to work, but it’s too fun to blow up everything else and deal double digit damage to everyone. Just be careful because it hits you too.</p>

<p>Two to three boardwipes will usually suffice in this deck, as you are the aggressor. If you feel more are needed, Star of Extinction is a good option.</p>

<p>Damage Amplifiers:</p>

<p>Remember that extra combat phases will exponentially increase the Xenagos boosts.</p>

<p>Rancor: Nothing flashy, but for only one green, it basically gives four power, and Trample for some of the creatures like Hydra Omnivore or Inferno Titan, and keeps putting itself back in your hand.</p>

<p>Strionic Resonator: Can copy Xenagos’ trigger for quadruple damage, or copy some of the other creature abilities.</p>

<p>Blood Mist: Make anybody Atarka </p>

<p>Grab the Reins: I am not making another section just for this card so it’s going here. Usually the Fling effect is the right choice, to reach for the extra damage or just in response to your fatty getting removed. The Threaten effect or using Entwine will be relevant sometimes.</p>

<p>Seize the Day: For only four mana, you can give your big guy an extra attack, and it can be flashed back later for only three.</p>

<p>Gratuitous Violence: Doubles your damage without actually giving Double Strike, which is great. The only bad thing about this card is the three red symbols in its cost, which sometimes animates Xenagos when you don’t want him to be.</p>

<p>Savage Beating: Both modes are good on their own, but if you Entwine a creature and put all of Xenagos’ power into it, it will reach hextuple damage if it doesn’t already have Double Strike.</p>

<p>Hellkite Charger: Most reliable late game when you have a ton of mana. Also works if he somehow lives through a round of turns.</p>

<p>Hunter’s Prowess: We’ve talked about this.</p>

<p>Warstorm Surge: Everyone is now a better Gruul Ragebeast.</p>

<p>Some more choices worth running are World at War for its Rebound, Insult, Temur Battle Rage, and Soul’s Fire.</p>

<h1><b>Land Choices</b></h1>

<p>Finally, we have reached the lands. There are only a few ones I want to talk about and some general building strategies.</p>

<p>In a two color deck, you can afford to be a little greedier and run more utility lands. In any deck that has green, I always skew the landbase to be more green than what the actual color proportions are because if you have green, you can cast your ramp and pull out whatever color you need anyway.</p>

<p>Homeward Path: A nice insurance policy against people who would “borrow” your giants. It’s a little pricy, but definitely worth it.</p>

<p>Kessig Wolf Run: A good mana sink to give a multipliable boost to the turn’s fatty, and Trample if they need it.</p>

<p>Mosswort Bridge: The Hideaway condition is easily met in this deck. It will let you keep a surprise tool that will help you later.</p>

<p>Rogue’s Passage: Sometimes you just really need the evasion.</p>

<p>Sheltered Thicket: Many games will have you use the Cycling, when you have all the mana you could want but not the answer or creature you want.</p>

<p>If you have money, there are all sorts of land base upgrades I probably don’t have to tell you about. Just a reminder that Dryad Arbor+Green Sun’s Zenith is a thing and that if your land base is better, cards like Farseek and Nature’s Lore that care about land type become better too.</p>
