    It’s the most wonderful time of the year… Spring Announcement Day! This
    morning, Wizards posted a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&amp;v=j_qvw0JrswA">
        video
    </a>
    of Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff (of
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xWgtukXNLwPDdJvR_YcEg">
        Magic The Amateuring
    </a>
    ) sitting down with Doug Beyer (Senior Creative Designer), Gavin Verhey
    (Senior Game Designer), and Dawn Murin (Senior Art Director) to discuss
    what’s in store for the next year. Terrible puns aside, the announcement
    gave us a pretty decent look into the next block in standard, as well as a
    peek into the new Battlebond set. Without further ado:

    Announcement Day has brought our first spoiled Battlebond duo! Check them

    So if you expected gritty, grizzled soldiers, I guess you were a bit off.
    Personally, I welcome the Power of Friendship in the meta. Also, note the
    “Partner with…” reminder text. Yes, these cards are commander legal and
    yes, they do work like other Partner commanders. And don’t worry about
    having to hunt down your duo’s second half for your teammate’s deck; the
    cards come paired with their buddy in the same pack!

    Okay, so they gave it a different name, but that’s what I’d call it if they
    asked me. Which they didn’t.

    The three part block will officially release November 5, 2018 with Guilds
    of Ravnica.

    The set will focus on half of the classic Ravnican Guilds that we know and
    love:

<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The second set, Ravnica Allegiance, will come out sometime in January 2019,
    and focus on the rest of the guilds. The devs seem to want to keep info
    about the as-yet-unnamed final set a secret, but as long as the pattern
    holds, we’ll see it sometime in April 2019.

<p dir="ltr">
    In the same vein as the new block, we’re going to be getting a new product
    line starting in November: Guild Kits.

    These kits are going to be theme decks, each revolving around one of the
    guilds. They’ll be released in two groups. The first bunch (corresponding
    to the guilds in Guilds of Ravnica) will be released November 2, 2018. The
    second bunch (corresponding to Ravnica Allegiance) will be out January 19,
    2019.

    Murin also gave us some insights into some of the aesthetics we can look
    forward to seeing. The setting will be Ravnica in autumn, with changing
    leaves and rain-streaked streets. Does this mean we’ll get to see
    Borborygmos cafe blogging and sipping a pumpkin spice latte? Given the
    updates to guild fashion, it doesn’t look likely. Murin hinted at a punky,
    aggro (ha) vibe for the red / green social anarchists. We also got a sneak
    peek at a sleeker Simic. Gone (or at least toned down) are the Crocanuras
    of old; the new Simic have moved onto more practical experiments. What
    exactly this means, time will tell. The Golgari, meanwhile, look like
    they’re set to fit right in with the new fungal meta; members of the Swarm
    have donned mushroom evening wear. The final guild Murin talked about, the
    Rakdos, has gone all in on their freakshow roots. Here’s to red / black
    debauchery!
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    But more importantly… Here’s to the Rereturn to Ravnica City of Ravnica!
